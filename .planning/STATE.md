# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-15)

**Core value:** Documentation happens automatically as the medic does their job, not as separate admin work.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Foundation)
Plan: 4 of 5 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-15 — Completed 01-04-PLAN.md (Authentication with offline session persistence)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 20% (4/20 plans across all active phases)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 4 min
- Total execution time: 0.28 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 4/5 | 17 min | 4 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (5 min), 01-02 (5 min), 01-03 (2 min), 01-04 (5 min)
- Trend: Stable (consistent ~4-5 min per plan)

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Offline-first architecture: Construction sites have unreliable connectivity; app must work without signal
- iOS-first, no Android: Kai and target medics use iPhones; avoid multi-platform complexity in MVP
- Supabase for backend: PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage + UK hosting in one managed service, fast to ship
- React Native with Expo: Faster iOS development, JavaScript alignment with web dashboard
- Weekly PDF as core deliverable: Site managers need this for HSE audits; auto-generation justifies premium pricing

**From Plan 01-01:**
- D-01-01-001: Use Expo SDK 54 managed workflow for faster iOS development (avoids Xcode complexity)
- D-01-01-002: Enable TypeScript strict mode from Day 1 to catch type errors early
- D-01-01-003: Configure Supabase with detectSessionInUrl: false (mobile apps don't use URL-based auth)
- D-01-01-004: Store encryption keys in expo-secure-store (hardware-backed Keychain/Keystore, GDPR-compliant)
- D-01-01-005: Defer SQLCipher encryption to Plan 01-03 (WatermelonDB PR #907 not yet merged)

**From Plan 01-03:**
- D-01-03-001: Defer SQLCipher encryption to Phase 2 (WatermelonDB PR #907 not merged, per research)
- D-01-03-002: Use epoch milliseconds for all timestamps (number type, not Date objects)
- D-01-03-003: audit_log table has no server_id (write-once, synced via queue, not WatermelonDB sync)
- D-01-03-004: JSON sanitizers return empty arrays on parse failure (defensive programming)
- D-01-03-005: Sync queue priority: 0 = RIDDOR immediate, 1 = normal
- D-01-03-006: Enable JSI adapter for better iOS performance

**From Plan 01-04:**
- D-01-04-001: Session cached in AsyncStorage not SecureStore (Supabase convention, already encrypted with JWT)
- D-01-04-002: Biometric flags in SecureStore with requireAuthentication: true (hardware-backed, auto-invalidates on biometric change)
- D-01-04-003: Local JWT expiry check when offline (accepts staleness up to 1 hour for construction site offline periods)
- D-01-04-004: Type assertion for profiles query result (Supabase TypeScript client type inference issue)
