## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Offline-first architecture: Construction sites have unreliable connectivity; app must work without signal
- iOS-first, no Android: Kai and target medics use iPhones; avoid multi-platform complexity in MVP
- Supabase for backend: PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage + UK hosting in one managed service, fast to ship
- React Native with Expo: Faster iOS development, JavaScript alignment with web dashboard
- Weekly PDF as core deliverable: Site managers need this for HSE audits; auto-generation justifies premium pricing
