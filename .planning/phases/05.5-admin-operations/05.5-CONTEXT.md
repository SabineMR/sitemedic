# Phase 5.5: Admin Operations Dashboards - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-16
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Admin-facing dashboard for managing the entire SiteMedic platform. Extends the existing Phase 4 web dashboard with admin-specific capabilities across 6 major areas:
- Bookings management (approve/reject/reassign/cancel)
- Medic roster management (availability, territory assignments, utilization tracking)
- Territory coverage map (visual representation with utilization color coding)
- Revenue dashboard (platform fees per territory/medic, cash flow projections)
- Timesheet approval (batch workflow for Friday payouts)
- Client management (payment terms, booking history, Net 30 upgrades)

New analytics features, advanced reporting, or additional admin capabilities beyond these 6 areas belong in future phases.

## Implementation Decisions

### Dashboard Navigation
- **Sidebar navigation** — Vertical sidebar with icons + labels (consistent with Phase 4 dashboard pattern)
- **Overview landing page** — Admins land on overview dashboard showing key metrics, urgent items, and recent activity
- Navigate to specific areas (Bookings, Medics, Territories, Revenue, Timesheets, Clients) via sidebar

### Claude's Discretion
The user explicitly requested Claude handle the following implementation decisions during planning:
- **Urgent item surfacing** — How to display pending approvals, coverage gaps, cash flow warnings (badges, banners, or overview cards)
- **Data visualization approach** — Chart types, interactivity levels, real-time updates for territory maps, revenue charts, utilization graphs
- **Bulk operations workflows** — Batch timesheet approval patterns, multi-select UI, confirmation flows, undo capabilities
- **Alert and priority signaling** — Color coding, notification patterns, dashboard badges for urgent administrative tasks
- **Filtering and search** — How admins find specific bookings, medics, or clients quickly across large datasets
- **Page layouts** — Information density, card vs table layouts, responsive behavior for each of the 6 admin areas

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

**Performance requirement:**
- Batch timesheet approval must handle 20 timesheets in <5 minutes (success criteria #5)

**Visual requirements:**
- Territory coverage map uses color-coded utilization: green (<50%), yellow (50-80%), red (>80%)
- Coverage gap alerts trigger when rejection rate >10% in territory
- Cash flow projection warns when gap >30 days (paying medics before collecting from clients)

**Data patterns:**
- Extends existing Phase 4 dashboard (same framework, authentication, styling)
- 6 distinct admin areas with different data types and workflows
- Real-world admin workflows: Friday payout approvals, booking conflict resolution, territory optimization
