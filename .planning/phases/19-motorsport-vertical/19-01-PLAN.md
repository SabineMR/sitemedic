<objective>
Add motorsport-specific form fields, concussion clearance gate, and concussion notification alert to the mobile treatment form.

Purpose: When a medic is working at a motorsport event, the treatment form must capture Motorsport UK-required data (GCS score, extrication, helmet removed, circuit section, Clerk of Course notification, competitor car number) and enforce a mandatory three-step concussion clearance workflow (HIA conducted, competitor stood down, CMO notified) that cannot be bypassed. When a concussion treatment is submitted, a notification record is created in medic_alerts for admin visibility. This satisfies MOTO-01 and MOTO-03 (both the mobile gate and the admin notification record).

Output: `services/taxonomy/motorsport-fields.ts` (interface + defaults), updated `app/treatment/new.tsx` with motorsport section, concussion gate, and concussion alert, migration `126_motorsport_concussion_alert_type.sql`.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create MotorsportExtraFields interface and taxonomy file</name>
  <files>services/taxonomy/motorsport-fields.ts</files>
  <action>
    Create `services/taxonomy/motorsport-fields.ts` with:

    1. `MotorsportExtraFields` interface matching the JSONB shape from research:
       - Core fields: `gcs_score: number | null`, `extrication_required: boolean`, `helmet_removed: boolean`, `concussion_suspected: boolean`, `competitor_car_number: string`, `circuit_section: string`, `clerk_of_course_notified: boolean`, `competitor_cleared_to_return: boolean`
       - Concussion clearance gate fields: `hia_conducted: boolean`, `competitor_stood_down: boolean`, `cmo_notified: boolean`
       - Optional additional fields: `vehicle_type?: string`, `incident_type?: string`, `helmet_condition?: string`, `licences_to_msuk?: boolean`

    2. `INITIAL_MOTORSPORT_FIELDS` constant of type `MotorsportExtraFields` with all booleans false, strings empty, gcs_score null.

    3. `MOTORSPORT_INCIDENT_TYPES` array: `['collision', 'single_vehicle', 'track_incident', 'pit_lane', 'paddock', 'spectator_area', 'other']` as const.

    4. `VEHICLE_TYPES` array: `['car', 'kart', 'bike', 'rally_car', 'other']` as const.

    Follow the naming conventions of other taxonomy files (e.g., `injury-types.ts`, `mechanism-presets.ts`). Use JSDoc comment block at top explaining the file's purpose and which phase/requirements it satisfies.
  </action>
  <verify>
    `npx tsc --noEmit services/taxonomy/motorsport-fields.ts` compiles without errors (or equivalent TS check). File exports `MotorsportExtraFields`, `INITIAL_MOTORSPORT_FIELDS`, `MOTORSPORT_INCIDENT_TYPES`, `VEHICLE_TYPES`.
  </verify>
  <done>
    `services/taxonomy/motorsport-fields.ts` exists with a fully typed `MotorsportExtraFields` interface, a default initial state constant, and enum arrays for incident types and vehicle types.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add motorsport fields section and concussion gate to treatment form</name>
  <files>app/treatment/new.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Modify `app/treatment/new.tsx` to add:

    **A. State declaration (near other form state, around line 67):**
    ```typescript
    import { MotorsportExtraFields, INITIAL_MOTORSPORT_FIELDS } from '../../services/taxonomy/motorsport-fields';
    // ...
    const [motorsportFields, setMotorsportFields] = useState<MotorsportExtraFields>(INITIAL_MOTORSPORT_FIELDS);
    ```

    **B. Motorsport Details section (after the outcome section, conditional on `orgVertical === 'motorsport'`):**
    Render a new section card titled "Motorsport Details" containing:
    - GCS Score: `TextInput` with `keyboardType="number-pad"`, validated 3-15. Use existing `styles.textArea` style.
    - Competitor Car Number: `TextInput` with placeholder "e.g. 42"
    - Circuit Section: `TextInput` with placeholder "e.g. Turn 3, Paddock, Pit Lane"
    - Boolean toggles using the existing `treatmentTypeButton` / `treatmentTypeButtonSelected` style pattern (lines 733-756 of current file): Extrication Required, Helmet Removed at Scene, Clerk of Course Notified, Concussion Suspected
    - Each boolean toggle is a `Pressable` that flips the boolean in `motorsportFields`.

    **C. Concussion clearance panel (inside the motorsport section, conditional on `motorsportFields.concussion_suspected`):**
    Render a warning card with amber/orange border (similar to RIDDOR banner pattern at lines 636-648) titled "Concussion Clearance Required" with subtitle "All three items must be confirmed before completing this record". Three checkboxes:
    - HIA (Head Injury Assessment) conducted
    - Competitor stood down from event
    - Chief Medical Officer (CMO) notified

    Use same `Pressable` toggle pattern with a distinct checked style (green background when checked).

    **D. Concussion gate in `handleCompleteTreatment` (insert after cert validation gate at line 285, before the existing field validation at line 288):**
    ```typescript
    // Motorsport concussion clearance gate — cannot be bypassed
    if (orgVertical === 'motorsport' && motorsportFields.concussion_suspected) {
      const { hia_conducted, competitor_stood_down, cmo_notified } = motorsportFields;
      if (!hia_conducted || !competitor_stood_down || !cmo_notified) {
        Alert.alert(
          'Concussion Clearance Required',
          'When concussion is suspected, you must confirm:\n- HIA conducted\n- Competitor stood down\n- CMO notified\n\nbefore completing this record.',
          [{ text: 'OK' }]
        );
        return;
      }
    }
    ```

    **E. Include motorsport fields in the sync payload (in the `enqueueSyncItem` call, around line 338-365):**
    The sync payload must include BOTH `event_vertical` and `vertical_extra_fields`. Verify the existing code at lines 360-361 already includes:
    ```typescript
    event_vertical: treatment.eventVertical ?? null,
    vertical_extra_fields: treatment.verticalExtraFields ?? null,
    ```
    **Critical:** Confirm `event_vertical` is set to `orgVertical` in the sync payload. The treatment model's `eventVertical` field must be populated from `orgVertical` (the route param / org primary vertical). If `treatment.eventVertical` is not already set when the treatment is created, ensure it is set during the WatermelonDB update:
    ```typescript
    t.eventVertical = orgVertical ?? null;
    ```
    This is essential because the RIDDOR detector reads `treatment.event_vertical` from the sync payload to decide whether to skip RIDDOR processing.

    For `vertical_extra_fields`, ensure the WatermelonDB update (Step F) writes the JSON string so the sync payload picks it up correctly.

    **F. Include motorsport fields in the WatermelonDB auto-save update (in the treatment.update callback):**
    Add `t.verticalExtraFields = orgVertical === 'motorsport' ? JSON.stringify(motorsportFields) : undefined;`

    **G. Add styles for the concussion gate banner:**
    Add to the StyleSheet: `concussionGateBanner` (amber/orange border, padding 16, marginTop 16, borderRadius 12, borderWidth 2, borderColor '#f59e0b', backgroundColor '#fffbeb'), `concussionGateTitle` (fontSize 16, fontWeight '700', color '#92400e'), `concussionGateSubtitle` (fontSize 13, color '#92400e', marginBottom 12), `clearanceCheckbox` and `clearanceCheckboxChecked` styles matching the treatmentTypeButton pattern but with green checked state.

    **Important:** Do NOT use emoji in the UI text. Use plain text for checkbox labels.
  </action>
  <verify>
    1. `npx tsc --noEmit` passes for the treatment form (no TypeScript errors).
    2. `pnpm dev` starts without build errors.
    3. Open the treatment form with `?event_vertical=motorsport` route param — the "Motorsport Details" section renders.
    4. Toggle "Concussion Suspected" ON — the clearance panel appears.
    5. Try to complete the treatment with concussion suspected but clearance items unchecked — `Alert.alert` fires and blocks submission.
    6. Check all three clearance items, complete treatment — submission proceeds.
  </verify>
  <done>
    The treatment form conditionally renders motorsport-specific fields when `orgVertical === 'motorsport'`. The concussion clearance gate blocks form submission when concussion is suspected but the three-part checklist is incomplete. Motorsport fields are stored in `vertical_extra_fields` both locally (WatermelonDB) and in the sync payload (Supabase). The sync payload explicitly includes `event_vertical: orgVertical`.

  <name>Task 3: Create concussion alert migration and insert notification on concussion treatment submission</name>
  <files>supabase/migrations/126_motorsport_concussion_alert_type.sql, app/treatment/new.tsx</files>
  <action>
    **A. Create `supabase/migrations/126_motorsport_concussion_alert_type.sql`:**

    The `medic_alerts.alert_type` column has a CHECK constraint (from migration 008) that only allows specific values. Add `'motorsport_concussion'` to the allowed values:

    ```sql
    -- Migration 126: Add motorsport_concussion alert type
    -- Purpose: MOTO-03 requires admin notification when concussion is suspected at a motorsport event
    -- Created: 2026-02-18

    -- Drop existing CHECK constraint on alert_type
    ALTER TABLE medic_alerts DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS medic_alerts_alert_type_check;

    -- Recreate with motorsport_concussion added
    ALTER TABLE medic_alerts ADD CONSTRAINT medic_alerts_alert_type_check
      CHECK (alert_type IN (
        'battery_low',
        'battery_critical',
        'late_arrival',
        'early_departure',
        'connection_lost',
        'not_moving_20min',
        'geofence_failure',
        'gps_accuracy_poor',
        'shift_overrun',
        'motorsport_concussion'
      ));

    COMMENT ON CONSTRAINT medic_alerts_alert_type_check ON medic_alerts
      IS 'Allowed alert types including motorsport_concussion (Phase 19, MOTO-03)';
    ```

    **B. Add concussion alert insertion to `app/treatment/new.tsx`:**

    After the `enqueueSyncItem` call (around line 365, after the sync enqueue but before the photo queue), add a concussion notification insert. The `supabase` client is already imported at line 48.

    ```typescript
    // MOTO-03: Create admin alert for motorsport concussion
    if (orgVertical === 'motorsport' && motorsportFields.concussion_suspected) {
      try {
        await supabase.from('medic_alerts').insert({
          medic_id: treatment.medicId,
          booking_id: treatment.bookingId,
          org_id: treatment.orgId,
          alert_type: 'motorsport_concussion',
          alert_severity: 'high',
          alert_title: 'Motorsport Concussion Suspected',
          alert_message: `Concussion suspected for competitor #${motorsportFields.competitor_car_number || 'unknown'} at ${motorsportFields.circuit_section || 'unknown section'}. Clearance status: HIA ${motorsportFields.hia_conducted ? 'done' : 'pending'}, stood down ${motorsportFields.competitor_stood_down ? 'yes' : 'pending'}, CMO ${motorsportFields.cmo_notified ? 'notified' : 'pending'}.`,
          metadata: {
            treatment_id: treatment.id,
            reference_number: treatment.referenceNumber,
            competitor_car_number: motorsportFields.competitor_car_number,
            circuit_section: motorsportFields.circuit_section,
            gcs_score: motorsportFields.gcs_score,
            hia_conducted: motorsportFields.hia_conducted,
            competitor_stood_down: motorsportFields.competitor_stood_down,
            cmo_notified: motorsportFields.cmo_notified,
            competitor_cleared_to_return: motorsportFields.competitor_cleared_to_return,
          },
        });
      } catch (alertErr) {
        // Non-blocking: alert insertion failure should not prevent treatment completion
        console.warn('Failed to create motorsport concussion alert:', alertErr);
      }
    }
    ```

    **Important:** This insert is non-blocking (wrapped in try/catch). If the device is offline, the Supabase insert will fail silently, but the treatment is still enqueued for sync. The alert serves as a best-effort admin notification. The dashboard concussion badge (Plan 04) provides the primary safety net regardless of whether this alert succeeds.

    **Important:** The `bookingId` may be null if the treatment was not created from a booking. In that case, the insert will fail due to the NOT NULL constraint on `booking_id`. Add a guard:
    ```typescript
    if (orgVertical === 'motorsport' && motorsportFields.concussion_suspected && treatment.bookingId) {
    ```
  </action>
  <verify>
    1. `supabase/migrations/126_motorsport_concussion_alert_type.sql` exists and is syntactically valid SQL.
    2. The CHECK constraint includes all original alert types PLUS `'motorsport_concussion'`.
    3. In `app/treatment/new.tsx`, the concussion alert insert is placed after `enqueueSyncItem` and before the photo queue.
    4. The insert is wrapped in try/catch and guarded by `treatment.bookingId` being truthy.
    5. `npx tsc --noEmit` passes.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Migration 126 adds `'motorsport_concussion'` to the `medic_alerts.alert_type` CHECK constraint. When a motorsport concussion treatment is submitted, a `medic_alerts` record is created with severity 'high', including treatment details in the metadata JSONB field. This satisfies MOTO-03's admin notification requirement.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. TypeScript compilation: `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with no errors on modified files.
2. The motorsport fields section does NOT render when `orgVertical` is any other value (e.g., 'construction', 'general').
3. The concussion gate is a hard block — `return` statement prevents any downstream completion logic from running.
4. `motorsportFields` state is serialized to JSON string for WatermelonDB and included in the sync payload.
5. GCS score input rejects values outside 3-15 range.
6. The sync payload includes `event_vertical: orgVertical` — confirmed by checking the treatment model's `eventVertical` field.
7. A `motorsport_concussion` alert is inserted into `medic_alerts` when concussion is suspected (non-blocking, guarded by bookingId).
8. Migration 126 extends the CHECK constraint without breaking existing alert types.

<success_criteria>
- `services/taxonomy/motorsport-fields.ts` exports `MotorsportExtraFields`, `INITIAL_MOTORSPORT_FIELDS`, `MOTORSPORT_INCIDENT_TYPES`
- `app/treatment/new.tsx` renders motorsport fields section for motorsport vertical only
- Concussion gate blocks submission when concussion suspected and clearance incomplete
- All form data persists to WatermelonDB `vertical_extra_fields` column as JSON string
- Sync payload includes `vertical_extra_fields` and `event_vertical` for Supabase
