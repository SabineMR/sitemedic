<objective>
Verify (do NOT rebuild) that the Phase 18 RIDDOR gate is active for the festivals vertical. Confirm `festivals` is in the `NON_RIDDOR_VERTICALS` array in both `riddor-detector` and `riddor-f2508-generator`. Confirm `VERTICAL_COMPLIANCE.festivals.riddorApplies` is `false`. No code changes expected.

Purpose: FEST-03 — regression verification that festival-goer treatments never trigger RIDDOR. This is a read-only verification plan.
Output: Confirmation that the gate is live, or identification of gaps requiring a fix task.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Verify RIDDOR gate includes 'festivals' in both Edge Functions and vertical-compliance config</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
    This is a READ-ONLY verification task. Do NOT modify any files unless a gap is found.

    **Step 1: Verify riddor-detector gate**
    Read `supabase/functions/riddor-detector/index.ts` and confirm:
    - `NON_RIDDOR_VERTICALS` array exists (expected at lines 74-99)
    - `'festivals'` is included in the array
    - The gate uses `NON_RIDDOR_VERTICALS.includes(effectiveVertical)` to early-return `{ detected: false }`
    - The early return happens BEFORE `detectRIDDOR()` is called

    **Step 2: Verify riddor-f2508-generator validation**
    Read `supabase/functions/riddor-f2508-generator/index.ts` and confirm:
    - `NON_RIDDOR_VERTICALS` array exists (expected at lines 102-110)
    - `'festivals'` is included in the array
    - The validation returns HTTP 400 for non-RIDDOR verticals

    **Step 3: Verify vertical-compliance config**
    Read `services/taxonomy/vertical-compliance.ts` and confirm:
    - `VERTICAL_COMPLIANCE.festivals` entry exists
    - `riddorApplies` is `false`
    - `primaryFramework` is `'purple_guide'`

    **Step 4: If all three verifications pass**
    Report: "RIDDOR gate verified — no code changes needed."

    **Step 5: If ANY verification fails**
    Fix the specific gap:
    - If `'festivals'` is missing from a NON_RIDDOR_VERTICALS array, add it
    - If `riddorApplies` is not `false`, correct it
    - Document any fix in the summary
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run these grep commands to confirm (all should return matches):
    1. `grep -n "festivals" supabase/functions/riddor-detector/index.ts` — at least 1 match
    2. `grep -n "festivals" supabase/functions/riddor-f2508-generator/index.ts` — at least 1 match
    3. `grep -n "riddorApplies.*false" services/taxonomy/vertical-compliance.ts` — at least 1 match in festivals block
    4. `grep -n "NON_RIDDOR_VERTICALS" supabase/functions/riddor-detector/index.ts` — confirms array exists
    5. `grep -n "detected.*false" supabase/functions/riddor-detector/index.ts` — confirms early return
    6. `git diff --name-only` — should show NO changes (read-only task)
  </verify>
  <done>
    - 'festivals' confirmed in NON_RIDDOR_VERTICALS in riddor-detector/index.ts
    - 'festivals' confirmed in NON_RIDDOR_VERTICALS in riddor-f2508-generator/index.ts
    - VERTICAL_COMPLIANCE.festivals.riddorApplies confirmed as false
    - RIDDOR gate returns { detected: false } before detectRIDDOR() runs for festivals
    - F2508 generator returns HTTP 400 for festivals vertical
    - No code changes made (or gap fix documented if needed)
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After task completion:
1. All 5 grep checks return matches
2. No files were modified (unless a gap was found and fixed)
3. FEST-03 requirement is satisfied: festival-goer treatments never produce a RIDDOR flag
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- FEST-03 verified: The RIDDOR detector gate returns { detected: false } for festivals before any RIDDOR logic executes
- F2508 generator returns HTTP 400 if called with a festivals treatment (defense in depth)
- VERTICAL_COMPLIANCE.festivals.riddorApplies is false (vertical config is consistent with the runtime gate)
- Zero code changes (ideal) or minimal targeted fix (if gap found)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/20-festivals-events-vertical/20-02-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
