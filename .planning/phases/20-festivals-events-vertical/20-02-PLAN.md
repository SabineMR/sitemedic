<objective>
Verify (read-only) that the Phase 18 RIDDOR gate is active for the festivals vertical. Confirm `festivals` is in the `NON_RIDDOR_VERTICALS` array in both `riddor-detector` and `riddor-f2508-generator`. Confirm `VERTICAL_COMPLIANCE.festivals.riddorApplies` is `false`. No code changes needed -- the gate was built in Phase 18.

Purpose: FEST-03 -- regression verification that festival-goer treatments never trigger RIDDOR. This is a read-only verification plan. Zero files modified.
Output: Confirmation that the gate is live. Summary documenting the verified state.

  <name>Task 1: Verify RIDDOR gate includes 'festivals' in both Edge Functions and vertical-compliance config</name>
  <files>
    supabase/functions/riddor-detector/index.ts
    supabase/functions/riddor-f2508-generator/index.ts

  <action>
    This is a READ-ONLY verification task. Do NOT modify any files.

    The RIDDOR gate for festivals was built in Phase 18. All three files already contain the correct values. This task confirms that state.

    **Step 1: Verify riddor-detector gate**
    Read `supabase/functions/riddor-detector/index.ts` and confirm:
    - `NON_RIDDOR_VERTICALS` array exists (line 75)
    - `'festivals'` is the first element in the array
    - The gate uses `NON_RIDDOR_VERTICALS.includes(effectiveVertical)` to early-return `{ detected: false }`
    - The early return happens BEFORE `detectRIDDOR()` is called (line 90 vs line 103)

    **Step 2: Verify riddor-f2508-generator validation**
    Read `supabase/functions/riddor-f2508-generator/index.ts` and confirm:
    - `NON_RIDDOR_VERTICALS` array exists (line 103)
    - `'festivals'` is the first element in the array
    - The validation returns HTTP 400 for non-RIDDOR verticals (lines 105-109)

    **Step 3: Verify vertical-compliance config**
    Read `services/taxonomy/vertical-compliance.ts` and confirm:
    - `VERTICAL_COMPLIANCE.festivals` entry exists (lines 122-134)
    - `riddorApplies` is `false` (line 127)
    - `primaryFramework` is `'purple_guide'` (line 123)
    - `patientIsWorker` is `false` (line 128)

    **Step 4: Report**
    All three checks should pass. Report: "RIDDOR gate verified -- no code changes needed. Phase 18 gate is active for festivals."
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run these grep commands to confirm (all should return matches):
    1. `grep -n "festivals" supabase/functions/riddor-detector/index.ts` -- at least 1 match
    2. `grep -n "festivals" supabase/functions/riddor-f2508-generator/index.ts` -- at least 1 match
    3. `grep -n "riddorApplies.*false" services/taxonomy/vertical-compliance.ts` -- at least 1 match in festivals block
    4. `grep -n "NON_RIDDOR_VERTICALS" supabase/functions/riddor-detector/index.ts` -- confirms array exists
    5. `grep -n "detected.*false" supabase/functions/riddor-detector/index.ts` -- confirms early return
    6. `git diff --name-only` -- should show NO changes (read-only task)
  </verify>
  <done>
    - All 5 grep checks returned matches
    - 'festivals' confirmed in both NON_RIDDOR_VERTICALS arrays
    - VERTICAL_COMPLIANCE.festivals.riddorApplies confirmed as false
    - VERTICAL_COMPLIANCE.festivals.primaryFramework confirmed as 'purple_guide'
    - RIDDOR gate returns { detected: false } before detectRIDDOR() runs for festivals
    - F2508 generator returns HTTP 400 for festivals vertical
    - Zero files modified
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After task completion:
1. All 5 grep checks return matches
2. Zero files modified -- `git diff --name-only` shows no changes
3. FEST-03 requirement is satisfied: festival-goer treatments never produce a RIDDOR flag
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- FEST-03 verified: The RIDDOR detector gate returns { detected: false } for festivals before any RIDDOR logic executes
- F2508 generator returns HTTP 400 if called with a festivals treatment (defense in depth)
- VERTICAL_COMPLIANCE.festivals.riddorApplies is false (vertical config is consistent with the runtime gate)
- Zero code changes -- this is purely a verification plan
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/20-festivals-events-vertical/20-02-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
