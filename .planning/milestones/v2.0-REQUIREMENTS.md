# Requirements: SiteMedic v2.0 — Multi-Vertical Platform Expansion

**Defined:** 2026-02-17
**Core Value:** Documentation happens automatically as the medic does their job, not as separate admin work.

## v2.0 Requirements

### VERT — Vertical Infrastructure

Core plumbing that all four new verticals depend on. Must ship before any vertical goes live.

- [x] **VERT-01**: RIDDOR auto-flagging only triggers when the active vertical has `riddorApplies: true` — festival-goers, motorsport competitors, and football players on-pitch never produce false RIDDOR flags
- [x] **VERT-02**: WatermelonDB v4 schema adds `vertical_id`, `booking_id`, `patient_type`, `gps_lat`, `gps_lng` to the treatments table (all nullable, single coordinated migration)
- [x] **VERT-03**: Mobile app fetches active vertical once at login via OrgContext — treatment form does not call Supabase on every mount to determine vertical
- [x] **VERT-04**: Booking-level vertical override is read by the mobile treatment form — a motorsport booking at a construction org shows motorsport presets, not construction presets
- [x] **VERT-05**: Admin can set a default vertical for their organisation in the org settings page
- [x] **VERT-06**: Client can select event type / vertical when creating a booking — the booking's `event_vertical` field is set at booking creation

### FILM — Film/TV Production Vertical

- [x] **FILM-01**: Film/TV incident form includes production-specific fields: Production Title, Patient Role (Cast / Stunt Performer / Crew), and SFX / Pyrotechnic Involved flag
- [x] **FILM-02**: App terminology switches to Film/TV context when vertical is active: "Cast & Crew" replaces "Worker", "Set" replaces "Site", "Production" replaces "Client"
- [x] **FILM-03**: Medic profile shows Film/TV-relevant cert types: HCPC registration, ScreenSkills Production Safety Passport, FREC 4 / EFR
- [x] **FILM-04**: RIDDOR auto-flagging remains active for Film/TV (crew are workers under HSE) — existing RIDDOR pipeline used with no changes to flagging logic

### FEST — Festivals & Events Vertical

- [x] **FEST-01**: Festival incident form captures TST triage category (P1 / P2 / P3 / P4) as a required field replacing standard outcome severity
- [x] **FEST-02**: Festival incident form includes Alcohol/Substance flag and Safeguarding concern flag
- [x] **FEST-03**: RIDDOR auto-flagging is disabled for festival-goer patients (Purple Guide framework, not HSE RIDDOR)
- [x] **FEST-04**: App terminology switches to events context: "Attendee" replaces "Worker", "Venue" replaces "Site", "Organiser" replaces "Client"
- [x] **FEST-05**: Medic profile shows events-relevant cert types: FREC 3 (minimum), IHCD Ambulance Aid, EFR
- [x] **FEST-06**: Festival incidents generate a Purple Guide–style event incident report PDF for the event organiser

### MOTO — Motorsport Vertical

- [x] **MOTO-01**: Motorsport incident form captures Motorsport UK Accident Form fields: GCS score, extrication required, helmet removed, concussion flag, competitor cleared to return to race
- [x] **MOTO-02**: Per-event Medical Statistics Sheet is generated automatically at end of event — aggregate of all incident records from that booking
- [x] **MOTO-03**: When concussion is flagged, the system triggers a licence suspension notification workflow — admin is alerted and a notification record is created for submission to Motorsport UK
- [x] **MOTO-04**: RIDDOR auto-flagging is disabled for motorsport competitor patients
- [x] **MOTO-05**: App terminology switches to motorsport context: "Competitor" replaces "Worker", "Circuit / Paddock" replaces "Site", "Organiser" replaces "Client"
- [x] **MOTO-06**: Medic profile shows motorsport-relevant cert types: Motorsport UK Medical Official Licence, ATLS, BASM
- [x] **MOTO-07**: Motorsport incidents generate a Motorsport UK–style Accident Form PDF per incident

### FOOT — Football / Sports Vertical

- [x] **FOOT-01**: Football incident form prompts medic to select patient type at start: Player or Spectator — form fields then differ based on selection
- [x] **FOOT-02**: Player incident form captures FA-aligned fields: Phase of Play, Contact / Non-Contact, HIA Concussion Assessment outcome, FA severity classification
- [x] **FOOT-03**: Spectator incident form captures SGSA-aligned fields: stand location, medical referral outcome, safeguarding flag
- [x] **FOOT-04**: RIDDOR auto-flagging is disabled for player on-pitch injuries (players are not workers under RIDDOR)
- [x] **FOOT-05**: App terminology switches to football context: "Player" replaces "Worker", "Pitch / Ground" replaces "Site", "Club" replaces "Client"
- [x] **FOOT-06**: Medic profile shows football-relevant cert types: ATMMiF (FA), ITMMiF (FA), FA Advanced Trauma Management
- [x] **FOOT-07**: Football incidents generate the appropriate PDF — FA incident report for player injuries, SGSA medical incident report for spectator injuries

### ANLT — Analytics: Heat Maps & Trend Charts

- [x] **ANLT-01**: Near-miss heat map visible on the org dashboard — GPS-clustered near-miss incidents plotted on a Leaflet map using CircleMarker, filtered to the current org
- [x] **ANLT-02**: Near-miss heat map visible on the platform admin dashboard — aggregate across all orgs, with org colour-coding
- [x] **ANLT-03**: Compliance scores are persisted to a `compliance_score_history` table weekly (upsert from the existing weekly report Edge Function)
- [x] **ANLT-04**: Compliance score trend chart on the org dashboard — weekly score plotted over the last 12 months using Recharts
- [x] **ANLT-05**: Incident frequency trend chart on the org dashboard — treatment + near-miss counts per week over the last 12 months
- [x] **ANLT-06**: Platform admin sees aggregate compliance trend across all orgs and top/bottom performing orgs by compliance score

## Milestone Summary

**Shipped:** 36 of 36 v2.0 requirements (100%)

**Requirements that changed scope during implementation:**
- VERT-02: Originally specified `vertical_id` and `patient_type` columns — implemented as `event_vertical` (string) and `vertical_extra_fields` (JSONB text) instead; functionally equivalent, better separation of concerns
- MOTO-07: Required gap closure plan (23-06) to complete web dashboard wiring — Edge Function was implemented in Phase 19 but UI card was not wired until Phase 23

**Requirements that required gap closure:**
- MOTO-07: motorsport-incident-generator Edge Function existed after Phase 19 but had no web UI trigger; wired in Phase 23 plan 23-06
- FOOT-07: fa-incident-generator Edge Function existed after Phase 22-03 but FAIncidentReportCard not wired into treatment detail; closed by Phase 22-05
- Flow 3 (relates to MOTO-01): competitor_cleared_to_return field in taxonomy but no mobile UI toggle; closed by Phase 23 plan 23-07

**Requirements dropped:** None — 36/36 shipped
